#### BOOK: Forex Patterns and Probabilities- by Ed Ponsi:

__Terminology:__ 

1) __Support:__ Whatever area that the chart doesn't tendency to go lower.

2) __Resistance:__ Whatever the area that the chart doesn't show tendency to go any higher.

3) __Break out:__ Anytime we see the price gets higher than the resistance, or lower than the support.

4) __Consolidation(Important):__ Anytime the chart gets trapped in an ever-narrowing area. Consolidation often leads to breakout.


__Interesting:__ USD/CAD has persistent long-term trends. CAD gets strong when the oil price gets strong, and it gets weak when oil price gets low.

Therefore, Anytime price of oil increases, the USD/CAD goes low which means CAD is getting stronger(because Canada is an oil producer and benefits from oil price increase.), so it makes sense to sell USD/CAD.

Also, CAD/JPY, when the price of oil increases, will go high because Japan in a major oil producer, and its economy hurts when the price of oil increases, so the chart goes up. SO, it is a good time to buy CAD/JPY.

__Commodity Currencies:__ The countries which their economies are greatly tied up with a specific commodity, like oil, have commodity currencies. So, there is always strong connections between the price of that commodity and the currency strength.

#### Three conditions of the market:

1) __Trending:__ when the currency pair has a clear trend (up or down).
2) __Range Bound:__ The currency pair, is being bounced between supply and resistance and moves horizontally.
3) __Consolodating:__ When the pair is trapped in a narrow, tightening area.

__Quote:__ Let your winning trades win. It means in most cases people leave winning trades too soon, because of the psychology behind it that they don't want to lose what they already gained. And most of the time they keep their losing trades last longer because of thinking it will be changed.

Most of the time when the market is trending, it's better to keep the right trade go longer.
