#### 5 Powerful Candlesticks patterns:

1) __Bullish Pin:__ When the candle is bullish but the difference between open and close is little, but there is a long lower shadow (2/3 of the whole candle stick's length). (bullish-pin.jpg)

When we have a group of bearish candles coming but at the bottom we see a bullish pin, there is a high probability that the trend is going up.

__Condition:__ The bullish pin should cut below one of the moving average lines, and it should be in uptrend(look at moving average orders.)


2) __Bearish Pin:__ It is opposite of bullish pin. Here is the photo of it: (bearish-pin.jpg)
