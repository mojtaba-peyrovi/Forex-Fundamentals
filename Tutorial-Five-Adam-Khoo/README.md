Here is the [source]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZqobytWXnI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZqobytWXnI))

Position sizing  is the part of  your trading system  that tells you how may contracts to buy/sell per trade. 
- For every trade, you have to size your position in a calculated way in order to have a positive winning expectancy.

#### Steps to calculate position sizing:
1- Check your net liquidation: check how much money you have available for trading. For example if we open a 5000 USD account, our liquidation will be 5000. (We also call it Account Equity)
2- Determine your risk per trade: Risk refers to the maximum loss per trade that we are willing to take, or maximum we lose if our stop loss is hit. 
> This loss SHOULD NOT be more than 1%-3% of your capital. Better to start with 1% per trade.

Never risk more than 1-3 percent of your money for any single trade. We start from 1 as beginners and STICK to it.

3- Determine your position size of each trade: here is the formula"
```
No. of Lots = (Net Liquidation x %risk per trade) / (Stop Loss Distance x $value per pip)
```
**Reminder:** One lot means 100,000 of the base currency.  0.5 lots in EURUSD means 50,000 EUR

In order to calculate $value per pip we can use online calculators like ([https://www.xm.com/forex-calculators/pip-value#forex-calculator](https://www.xm.com/forex-calculators/pip-value#forex-calculator) and we see it for the example above at pip-value-calculator.jpg

- In most pairs with USD as denominator, the value per pip is around 10$. 
Here is an example example1.jpg

The value we calculate in the example as EUR, will determine the leverage we are using, for example using 10,000 USD we buy 100,000 EUR, means our **Leverage** is around 10 times.

- Where we put the stop loss doesn't change the amount of risk we are taking. the risk percent will be always the same. 
- Always place your stop loss first, then you can determine the number of lots you are trading.
- In order to keep the risk constant, the number of lots to trade will be calculated based on the stop loss we put. 
		- It means the further the stop loss, the smaller the	number of lots, and vice versa.

#### Risk Management and Position Sizing:
- He recommends to have 1.5R as take profit position and 1R for stop loss and he said 1.5R is usually very much more profitable than 2R or 3R. He says not to be greedy. 
- He trades in M15 timeframe.

> For most people, once they lose 20% of their capital, it will affect them emotionally! We should never trade emotionally.

- Do not take more than two concurrent trades at a time. Use M15 timeline, and a trade will last an average 1-2 hours or less.
- Do not trade correlated trades at the same time for example (Long EURUSD, and Short USDJPY) because if USD goes strong we lose both trades.
- Take maximum of three trades per day.

#### Calculate Expectancy Per Trade:
Suppose we risk only 1% of the capital. and we expect our strategy to have 55% win rate and 45% lose rate:
```
Expectancy per trade = %win x (average win) - %loss(average loss) 
```
calculation: 
if the net liquidity is 47,912 USD, 
average loss = 1% x 47,912 = 479.12 USD  (because we just risk 1%)
average win = 1.5%x47,912 = 718.68 USD (because we always take 1.5R as profit)
Expectancy per trade = 55%(718.68) - 45% (479.12) = 395.27 - 215.6 = **179.67 USD**
20 trades per month = 179.67 * 20 = 3,593 USD
ROI = 3,593 / 47912 = **7.5%**  yearly = 12 * 7.5 = **100%**

#### calculation with 1000 USD:
average loss = 1% x 1000 = 10 USD
average win = 1.5% x 1000 = 15 USD
expectancy = 55%(15) - 45%(10) = 8.25 - 4.5 = **3.75 USD**
20 trades per month = 3.75 * 20 = 75 USD
ROI = 75/1000 = **7.5%** yearly = 12*7.5% = **100%**

But remember, this calculation are linear, and it supposes that the liquidity is always 1000 USD, but it adds up to itself each month and the average win will be higher and higher compared to average loss, so the ROI will be bigger and bigger.

Also, once we get more professional, we can increase the risk for 3%, and it makes the ROI so much bigger.
example:
average loss = 3% x 1000 = 30 USD
average win = 4.5% x 1000 = 45 USD
expectancy = 55%(45) - 45%(30) =  24.75 - 13.5 = **11.25 USD**
20 trades per month = 11.25 * 20 = 225 USD
ROI = 225/1000 = **22.5%** yearly = 12 * 72% = **270%**

The key point is, do not think about money because it is a very emotional thing. successful traders think about R multiples. 1R is a unit of risk in their minds. 
When we lose, we lose 1R and when we win, we win 1.5R. then at the end of the year we calculate the money we made.
