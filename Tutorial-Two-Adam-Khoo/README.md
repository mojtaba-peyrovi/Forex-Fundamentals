8) Once you master the skills Forex market let's you generate consistent profit. Profit rate of 5%-20% a month are very possible.

9) __Leverage__ gives you the power of buying a big amount of stock if you only have 1% of it in cash. So, when the currency moves so little, you can still make a lot of money.

10) Mastering the skills, you can easily generate 5000-20000 USD per month with an account of 100k USD. 

Here (forex-timing-table-singapore-time-one-hour-ahead-of-bkk.jpg) is the table of working hours for forex market in different countries. (it is based on Singapore time, which is ONE hour ahead of Bangkok.)

For example, 6AM-2PM is when Australian dollar is active (Singapore time). So, it will be 5AM-1PM Bangkok time.

Also at 7AM-3PM Bangkok time, Tokyo market will be open.

__NOTE:__ Most of people who trade EUR/USD, start looking at the market from 3 pm BKK time onwards.


#### How we read the exchange quote?

For example we say EUR/USD = 1.**3539**(4)

The fifth decimal digit, we don't care much about it. we mostly care for the first 4 decimal digits.

The Fourth digit is called __PIP.__ For example if the price from 1.3539 jumps to 1.3542 we say it has gone up by 3 pips.

or we can say:
```
1 pip = 0.0001
``` 
Except for JPY pairs that we say:
```
1 pip = 0.01
```
The fifth digit is actually called __Fractional pip.__

- __PIP__ is the smallest change in the currency rate that we care about.


#### Contract Lot Size:
In all currency pairs, a lot is always 100,000 of the base currency.(contract-lot-sizes.jpg)

Also we can buy the currencies in smaller lots (smaller-lots.jpg)

#### How to Calculate Forex Profit:

Here is the formula:

```
Profit = (number of pips) * (number of lots) * (dollar value per pip per lot)
```
THE VALUE OF EACH PIP IN A STANDARD LOT OF EUR/USD IS AROUND `10 USD`.

Here is a [link](https://www.investing.com/tools/forex-pip-calculator) that shows the price of the pip based on currency pair, and lot size.

Also here (pip-prices.jpg) is a screenshot of it just as an example. However, we need to get the prices daily. The link will show the updated prices.

- We can conclude, almost every pip in most popular pairs, is 10 USD per lot that we buy.

Check this example of profit calculation: (profit-calculation-example.jpg)

Also this example: (another-profit-example.jpg)

Because the fluctuation of currencies are so small, we use leverage, to get a reasonable profit. For example in order to make 400 USD, in reality we need 100,000 EUR. but with leverage of 1:100, we can make this money using 1,000 EUR.

```
Although we can use leverage of 1:100, it is better to be careful and just make it to 1:20 or less.
```

In Forex, we make money two ways:

1) `Sell HIGH, buy LOW`
2) `buy LOW, sell HIGH`

The former examples, were for the moment we made profit by the price going long. Now, we see making profit from going short:

And here is another explanation of it (another-profit-example(short).JPG)

#### Types of Traders:

There are four types of traders:

1) __Scalpers:__ they trade within seconds or minutes. The chart they use is M1, M5, and they target 5-10 pips per trade.
2) __Day Traders:__ They trade within a day. They target 20-40 pips per trade. and they look at M15, H1, H4 charts. In this method we just trade 2-3 times a day and we don't leave any trade open for the next day. (This makes the most sense and does 40 trades a month which is the best choice for me.)
3) __Swing Traders:__ They trade within a week and look at charts H1, H4. Their target is 50-150 pip per trade.
4) __Position Traders:__ They trade within months or even years. They target 500-1000 pips per trade and just look at D1, W1 charts. 

Here is the chart of all the types: (four-trader-types.jpg)


#### What makes a profitable Forex trader?

-  __Trading system:__ we need to have a trading system (strategy) that is statistically proven to win more than lose in long run. 90% of people lose money, because they don't have a trading system. or they have a system but don't follow it consistently. 

#### What gives us statistical edge in the market?

- __Trends:__ `We never go against the trend`. This is a rule that never changes.  
- __Support and Resistance:__  

    When we have resistance, it means `supply` is stronger than `demand.` so, the price is probably going to `reverse.` Sells are queueing in resistance levels.
    
    When we have support, it means there is more `demand` than `supply`. so the price will be probably going high. Buys are queueing up in support levels.
    
 ```
 Generally we will avoid buying near resistance and selling near support.
 
```   
- __Moving Averages:__ The most powerful tools to use. The moving averages are arranged in sequence. from the smallest to the biggest. He uses 6 EMA, 18 EMA, and 50 EMA, and 200 EMA. 

When we have uptrend movement, there will be __Impulsive waves__ and __correcting waves.__ And for each correcting wave, there will be a tiny change (support) in EMA lines. as we see in the photo: (up-trend-support.jpg).

When the trend is going downtrend, the average lines will be in the sequence, but opposite sequence, which means the smallest average will be below, and the biggest average will be on the top.

For downtrends, also we will see when impulsive and correcting waves happen, the average will get tiny changes (resistance). check this photo: downtrend-resistance.jpg

- __Fibonachi Levels:__ It says in uptrend, for an Impulsive wave, if the price goes up to a point with 100% move, there will be probably 61.8% level of correcting wave, before it gets back to uptrend. (uptrend-fibonachi.jpg)

#### We need to know when to trade:

many times in the chart we see it is random. There is no pattern. 
```
RULE: When the pattern is random DO NOT trade.
``` 
When there is not trend, people are impatient and try to find a trend, and here is when they lose money.
```
RULE: In trading not doing something, is something.
```
There are days that he doesn't trade at all. Because there is no trend found. Even sometimes for 3 days in a row he doesn't trade. Because the prices are not tradable.

#### When to get into the market and when not?

__Choppy chart:__ when the chart looks like this: choppy-chart.jpg we don't do anything.

When the moving average lines are not clearly slopping up or down this happens. When we have moving averages crossing each other all the time, it means there is no specific trend and its not tradable.


__Trending Bouncing Off 50 EMA:__ When the chart looks like this: boucing-off-50.jpg it shows there is a `strong trend going on`.

Also, when we have prices bounce a bit under 50 EMA (in uptrend), like this: bounce-off-50-prices-below.jpg, then we have to `have teh stop loss so much bigger than usual`. Better to use this strategy on H1 or H4.


__Trending Bouncing Off 18 EMA:__  in this case we better use __TCE Strategy.__

__Surfing EMA's:__ when the prices exactly aligns with one of the EMA's and goes up and down with it. (trend-surfing.jpg) In this case we use __Bull/Bear Flag Surfing strategy.__

#### Important question: how many times of bouncing should happen until we say it is bouncing? 

__Answer:__ only once. after that we can expect it to bounce at the same level.

#### Another sign for real uptrend: 

Higher highs, and lower lows. (photo: higher-highs-lower-low.jps) 

When we have bounce off 50, then see the higher highs and higher lows, then we do this:
```
we make a sell limit : entey will be at the higher low, stop loss will be so much lower than we normally do, and target price will be as much as the higher high. 
```
(bounce-off-50-sell-limit.jpg)

we do it in M15. But he always looks at one timeframe higher. then he will check if the moving averages are still in sequence. Also, he checks in H1, if the stop loss line is under multiple EMA lines.

- when we have bounce off 18 EMA, we place the buy limit according to this photo: (bounce-18-buy-limit.jpg)
