### ADX (Average Directional Index)

--- 

ADX is used to determine when the price is trending strongly. This indicator can be used for stock market too.

ADX is plotted as a single line with values ranging from a low of zero and a high of 100. 

ADX is non-directional. The higher the ADX is, the stronger the trend is. (no matter the direction.)

ADX is made of two other lines that come together with it. -DMI and +DMI. (DMI stands for Directional Movement Indicator.)

Here is the rule:

```
Wherever +DMI is above -DMI, the trend is upwards.
Whenever -DMI is above +DMI, the trnd is downwards.
In both situations, the ADX shows the trend's strength.
``` 
Here is the standard ADX metric:
```
0-25 : weak trend
25-50: strong trend
50-75: very strong trend
75-100: extremely strong trend
```
Low ADX is usually a sign of accumulation or distribution. When ADX is below 25 for more than 30 bars, it seems like the price is looking for buy/sell interest. When we have this situation, the price will eventually break out into a trend. either up or down. (low-adx-situations.jpg)

#### What is Retracement?

Retracements are temporary price reversals that take place within a larger trend. The key here is that these price reversals are temporary and do not indicate a change in the larger trend.

#### Higher highs, higher lows:
When the price moves up, it makes a new high, and when it drops, it begins to rally before reaching the previous low.While that is occurring, the trend is up. 

Here is an example: (higher-highs-higher-lows.jpg)

__IMPORTANT:__  the best trends rise out of periods of price range consolidation.
