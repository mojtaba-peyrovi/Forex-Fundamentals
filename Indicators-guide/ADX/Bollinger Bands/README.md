### Bollinger Bands:

--- 

Bollinger bands, will show two limits around the price chart that represent 2 times of the standard deviation above and under the moving average. It simply means that 95% of the prices fall between these two lines, therefore, anytime the prices reach this limit there is a high chance that it breaks and turns to the opposite direction.

It also shows the market's volatility, meaning that anytime we have high volatility, the gap between two bands will be wider and vice versa.
