- For each trade do not risk more than 1% of your money. (R=1%)
- For day trading, make 2-3 trades per day, which would be 50 trades per month, and 100 during two months of trading.
- All we need to make sure at the end of the two months, is to make sure "average profit trade" is bigger than "average loss trade"
(photo: sample-adam-khoo-statement.jpg) in two months, he started with 36,000$ and made 7700$. his win rate was only 53.47% versus the loss rate of 46.53%. if we divide 7700 by 36000 we see that he made 21% (21R) profit over two months and 100 trades.
- for the first 50 trades he lost 11%, but he didn't give up and kept trading and in the second month, he made it up.

#### Common mistakes of losers when they see a series of loses:
	
 When they lose money, they start to lose confidence. They start to think how to avoid loses. (while successful traders keep enjoying the game and they know this is a part of business.
	1- They start to look for a new strategy or indicator
	2- Avoid taking trades (Give up)
	3- Reduce risk per trade
	4- Increase the risk to make up the loss
	5- Start to take small profits to quickly make up the loss.
	6- Remove the stop loss (one bad trade will make them lose so much more)

#### What successful traders do instead?
> They keep confidently executing valid trade setups consistently. 

Here is the quote from Rocky (quote.jpg):
> Nobody is going to hit as hard as life (market). But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward. This is how winning is done!
