Resistance happens when we reach the ceiling of bullish, and the prices tend to reverse the trend to bearish.

Support is when bearish reach the bottom and tend to gain power to be bullish.

#### How to find the support-resistance lines?

In order to make sure the support or resistance is correct, we need to have __AT LEAST THREE__ test. It means that the prices should almost reach that price at least three times previously.

There is no guarantee that the prices stop moving upwards when they reach the resistance line or stop going lower than the support line, it is all about probability. We say the chance is very high that they reverse.

`we tend to buy at support level, and sell at resistance level.`

Be careful because when we talk about the these two lines, we talk about ZONE, and not exact line. So, seeing a test doesn't always mean that the price should cut the support or resistance. It can be approximately around that area.

`He normally trades based on M15.` 

We need to give some buffer (for M15, 8-12 pips) for our buy on support or sell on resistance because of the the zone concept. (photo: zone-concept.jpg)

Mostly, when we have a clear uptrend or downtrend, we don't see any support or resistance horizontal line. They mostly happen when the market is moving sidewise(consolidation.)


__How we know about 8-12 pips of buffer in M12?__ 
It comes from ATR (Average True Range). It should be DOUBLE of the ATR value. we open ATR indicator, find the approximate middle of it, and whatever the number was, we double it and set it as the buffer. (photo: buffer-based-on-atr.jpg)

__IMPORTANT:__ Often times, the resistance line, after the prices break them higher, become the support line for the next cycle. and a similar situation happens for support line, than become resistance line in the next time periods. `we will still count them as the test for next time periods.` (photo: support-resistance-conversion.jpg)

It is a very crucial technique to always find support-resistance levels and draw lines. Because it helps us to `never buy below the resistance level, and never sell right above support level.`

Anytime after a strong support/resistance with several tests, the trend will breakout strongly.
