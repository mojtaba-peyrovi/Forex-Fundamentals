---
7 major currencies that we need to keep eyes on:
__USD__, US dollar
__EUR__, The euro
__GBP__, Great British pound
__JPY__, Japanese yen
__CHF__, Swiss frank
__AUD__, Australian dollar

These currencies make the most volume of trade in the market on a daily basis.

Also there are 5 most common currency pairs:
1) EUR/USD
2) GBP/USD
3) USD/CAD
4) USD/CHF
5) AUD/USD

### Part 2: Three rules of trading markets
---

#### 1)  Dicipline:
    - Always follow the rules and don't come up with your own rules unless you have solid data that supports your rule.
    - Never double re-investment on a lost trade.
    - Never follow anyone's rules without any evidence.
### 2) Understand Success rate:
    - understand that sometimes trades don't go as we expect and it is out of ouor control. This is the nature of trade.
    - Dont change your strategy without solid data to prove it is wrong.
### 3) Emotional Control:
    - be patient, and control yyour emotions. 
    - Battle against yourself and not the market.
### Part 3: Technical and fundamental trading defined
---
__Technical analysis__:
- its based on chart analysis
- based on Chart patterns (set-ups)

__Fundamental analysis:
    - based on new and data
    - in this method we need to check monthly figures like non-farm payroll (NFP) for the US or on the weekly basis we need to check the unemployment numbers of USA.
    these data can shoot the chart drastically up or down and we should stay away of trading during these days.
