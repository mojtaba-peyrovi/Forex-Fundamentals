Source: [Capex Forex Trading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UPs5FdYEEA&list=PL1i3Ervq3ZvHaHqzRINvPjtxcC5PxhWq7)

### Part 1: What is Forex Market
---
7 major currencies that we need to keep eyes on:
__USD__, US dollar
__EUR__, The euro
__GBP__, Great British pound
__JPY__, Japanese yen
__CHF__, Swiss frank
__AUD__, Australian dollar
__CAD__, Canadian dollar

These currencies make the most volume of trade in the market on a daily basis.

Also there are 5 most common currency pairs:
1) EUR/USD
2) GBP/USD
3) USD/CAD
4) USD/CHF
5) AUD/USD

### Part 2: Three rules of trading markets
---

#### 1)  Dicipline:
    - Always follow the rules and don't come up with your own rules unless you have solid data that supports your rule.
    - Never double re-investment on a lost trade.
    - Never follow anyone's rules without any evidence.
### 2) Understand Success rate:
    - understand that sometimes trades don't go as we expect and it is out of ouor control. This is the nature of trade.
    - Dont change your strategy without solid data to prove it is wrong.
### 3) Emotional Control:
    - be patient, and control yyour emotions. 
    - Battle against yourself and not the market.
### Part 3: Technical and fundamental trading defined
---
__Technical analysis__:
- its based on chart analysis
- based on Chart patterns (set-ups)

__Fundamental analysis:__

 - based on news and data
    
 - in this method we need to check monthly figures like non-farm payroll (NFP) for the US or on the weekly basis we need to check the unemployment numbers of USA.
    these data can shoot the chart drastically up or down and we should stay away of trading during these days.
### Part 4: Data release for traders
---    
Data and news are important indicators for economy.They show the direction in which the economy is moving towards.
Sometimes during the release of a specific news we see huge sparks in the upwards or downwards direction. We need to know if the news has already priced into the market? if yes, then we shouldnt invest a lot on it because the changes on our chart would be minor. But if it hasn't we can trade as normal because we may benefit from the spikes that mentioned earlier.
- The importance of the news release also should be considered. The bigger the news, the bigger the influence on the market would happen.
So, we should focus on more important news and data.

__Important Release Sources__:
 Each country has a central bank. 
 1) ###### _European Central Bank (ECB)_:  
 Its decisions will affect all European countries including the UK. They have 2 major releases per month that we need to be aware of.
 2) ###### _Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)_
 3) ######  _Bank of England (BOE)_:
 They release important news once a month.
 4) ##### _Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)_:
 Their decision affect all economies in the world. They are based in USA and they meet 8 times a year.(Every 5-8 weeks).
 
 __Trading Guide__: We need to know leading individuals who lead each countries' Central bank. Research about them, learn about them and know when their speeches would release.Know the calendar of each speech and the importance of them.
 _IMPORTANT_: Give the market around 30 minutes to calm down after every news release so that it can get back to the normal state and don't make decision when all the market is excited.
 
 ### Part 5: Requirements for trading the markets
---   
We need to have at least 100 USD to start trading but before that it is so important to open a demo account and work with it and learn it at least for 3 months.

We need to find an online Forex broker. There is a sample list [Here](www.capexforextrading.com/forexbrokers)
 ### Part 6: Setting up your broker trading software part 1
---   
Each broker offers its own trading software, or somethings called MT4, and MT5.
I downloaded MT5 from a website I registered at called FXTM and it works successfully. 
We need some settings. 

* in order to change color scheme we can right click on the chart and go to Properties. 

 
#### Some basic concepts:

__EUR/USD:__ The first currency, is the 
__Base currency__ and the second currency is the __Counterpart Currency.__

When we look at the prices on the vertical axis on the right of each graph, we see for example 1.345564. What is the meaning of this?

- It means in order to buy one unit of the base currency, we need to spend 1.345564 unit of the counterpart.
##### What is BID?
on the left side of the charts where the buy/sell panel is located, we see buy/sel buttons and some prices for each. They change color between blue and red all the time. __The buy price is called BID.__

##### What is ASK?

On the same panel, __the sell price is called ASK.__

__SPREAD:__ when we have the difference between sell/buy, or ask/bid prices as 2 for example, we say __The spread in 2 pips wide.__ this 22 units is where brokers make money. 

When we start the trade, for any direction, if the spread is 2, we will be in debt for 2 pips. if we trade $1 per pip, we will be 2 pips in debt. Whatever direction we move to, we need to accumulate 2 pips at least to break even.

__High vs End of the session:__ when we have bar chart graph, as we see in the example (high-vs-end-session.jpg), the top point of each vertical line, is called high of the session, and the lowest point of the vertical line will be called the low of the session.

__Open vs Close of the session:__ When we check the photo open-vs-close-session.jpg, we see the horizontal like on the left side of each vertical line, is called open and the horizontal line on the right is called the close of the session.

When we have the close higher than open, the chart goes upwards, and vice versa.

__Up-Trend Chart:__ When the overall direction of the chart is going up we call it Up-Trend chart. 

__Down-Trend chart:__ Opposite of the sentence above.

__Current Market Price:__ It is highlighted on the vertical axis of each graph.

__Market Order:__ When we want to buy/sell at the current price of the market.

__Buy Limit order(When the chart is downtrend):__ It anticipates the bounce from a downtrend back to the upwards direction.

When we predict that the market price will be bouncing at a specific point, we put a __STOP LOSS__ line, wherever we guess the bouncing will happen, and then insert a stop loss line. If the graph hits the line, the stop loss will put me out of the market that means I won't lose more than that.

If it bounces upwards, and not hitting the stop-loss, then we can have a __profit target__ which is another line we put anywhere we want, and the we have to execute it by making a new order.
 (photo: buy-limit-downtrend.jpg)  
 
 In order to execute it, we make a new order, and on the popup we have set the type to __Pending Order__ and set the price and make the order.
 
 __Sell Limit Order(uptrend chart):__ when it goes up we will predict at a higher price, the graph will bounce downwards, so we put a line for it. we put another line for stop loss, and somewhere lower we set another line for profit target.
 
 Again, we place the order, and set the stop loss, and the price at which we predict. we set the type to pending order, and place it. 
 
__Buy Stop Order(uptrend charts):__ Another type of order is called buy stop. when we want to enter the market at a higher price, and continue up. we will put a stop loss line a bit lower than it and again place the order.
 
(photo: buy-stop.jpg)

__Sell Stop Order(downward charts):__ It is opposite of buy stop.

__Bullish Market:__ When the chart is uptrend obviously, we conclude that the traders who buy or go long, which are called __Bulls__, are dominating the market.
(bullish-and-momentum.JPG)

In the photo on the left side, the chart is bullish. As we can see, after connecting the tops of the previous trend, we see the long uptrend is taking the momentum, and here is where people can make good profit. There are techniques that we learn later and recognizes these momentum times.

Also, when we have a clear downtrend, we call it __Bearish market__ because traders who are short, or selling (__Bears__) are dominating the market. The law of momentum is also true here as we can see in the photo mentioned below

(bearish-and-momentum.JPG)

__IMPORTANT:__ There are some situations where the market has a lot of little up and downs in a row, and doesn't make any drastic change and it's stuck. During this time period, most of traders avoid to have any action and they just stay away. The reason is, the market during these time periods is getting all the strength to breakout and build a new trend.

#### What are Support Line and Resistance Line?

Support line is a horizontal line, that reverses the current downtrend back up in an upwards direction.
(support-line.jpg)

In order for a line to be qualified as a support line, it has to have two or more hits. 

Resistance line is opposite of the support line and happens when the uptrend line, doesn't have strength to keep going up, and here is when the resistance line happens. (resistance-line.JPG)

#### Change of Polarity Rule:

When a support line becomes a resistance line, and vice versa. This is when the trend is going up (or down) and stops the following the trend for a while, but again goes the same direction as before. (change-of-polarity.jpg)

#### Bullish Engulfing(covering):

When the second candle is white and covers all height of the first candle which is a black candle. It always happens at the bottom of a downtrend. here is an example (bullish-engulfing.jpg)

When this situation happens, we can decide the trend is turning back from down to up. 

Important thing is, the if the body of the second candle covers the body of the first candle, that's good enough to call it bullish engulfing. The shadows or wicks don't have to be covered.

__NOTE:__ DO NOT PLACE A BUY EVERY TIME A BULLISH ENGULFING HAPPENS.

The reason, is that they happen a lot, and a lot more confirmations are needed for a trend to be recognized as a good time to enter the market.

#### Bearish Engulfing (covering):

When the second candle is black and covers all the body of the second candle which is white, it is called bearish engulfing. and it happens on the top of the uptrend right at the time when the trend moves downwards.

Again anytime bearish engulfing happens, we shouldn't place an order because it needs more items to be checked before we decide to enter the market.

#### Piercing pattern:

It always happen at the bottom of a downtrend. It returns the downtrend to the upwards direction. The second candle (white) has to open below the first (black candle) It also has to close more than halfway into black candles REAL body. (piercing-pattern.jpg)

__NOTE:__ DO NOT PLACE A BUY EVERY TIME A BULLISH ENGULFING HAPPENS.

The reason, is that they happen a lot, and a lot more confirmations are needed for a trend to be recognized as a good time to enter the market.

 
#### Dark Cloud Pattern (opposite of piercing pattern):

It happens on the top of uptrend graphs, and happens when the first candle is white and second is black. The second candle has to open above the first candle, and also close more than a halfway into the first candle's REAL body. (dark-cloud-pattern.jpg)

For this also we don't enter the market anytime it happens.


#### Morning Star Pattern:

It comprises of THREE candles. The first one is a strong black, second one is a little candle that can be either black or white, and the third one, is a strong white. It always happens at the bottom of a downtrend. (morning-star-pattern.jpg) 

The first one has to be always strong black, the second one, has to be little and opening and closing under the black one, the third one is always a strong white, that opens above the second candle. and finally it has to close more than halfway into the first candle.

#### Evening Star Pattern:

It is the opposite of morning star pattern. It always happens at the top of an uptrend. The first one is always a strong white candle. The second one is a small one that opens and closes at or above the first white candle's close. The third candle, is always a strong black that opens and closes at or below the second candle's close, and close more than halfway into the first candle. (evening-star-pattern.jpg)

#### Doji Candle:

It looks like a cross. The meaning of it, is the open and close are at the same level. It represents an equilibrium between buyers and sellers. It means, because the open and close are at the same level, the market doesn't know which way to go. (doji-candle.jpg)

There are four types of doji candles that we see at doji-types.jpg

#### Morning Doji Star Pattern:

It is a three formation pattern. It comprises of three candles. the first on is a black candle, second one is a doji, and the third one is a white one. It always happens at the bottom od a downtrend pattern. The doji has to open and close below the black candle's close.  It is not required but preferred. The third one is a white that has to close above the first candle's close. The higher the white closes into the first black, the stronger the morning doji start pattern is. (morning-doji-star-pattern.jpg)

For this again we say, don't pace a buy anytime you see this pattern. because it needs more confirmations.       

#### Evening Doji Star Pattern:

It is opposite of the morning doji star pattern. The first one is a white, second one is a doji candle who's color doesn't matter. It always appears at the top of an uptrend. The doji has to open and close at or above the first candle's close. It is not required but preferred. The third candle which is a black, has to close below the first candle's close. The lower it closes into the first candle's body, the stronger the pattern will be. (evening-doji-star-pattern.jpg)

### ADX Indicator (Average Directional Index):

Why do we use this?

1) It shows if the market is trending. 
2) It shows how strong the trend is.

It has three lines:
 - First line is called +DI line. It only measures uptrends.
 - Second line is -dI line and measures the donwtrends.
 - The third line is the summation of both others.
 
 For the reason he didn't explain, we need to check out the value 25 for the ADX indicator, so we draw a horizontal line on 25. Anytime the third line which is tha main line crosses 25, it shows that a trend in the market is being built. Then we see if the higher the ADX third line goes, the stronger the trend will be.

#### Bollinger Bands:

It has three lines. 

1) __Simple Moving Average:__ It is the center line among the three lines. The distance between this line and the outer lines uses to calculate __Standard Deviations.__

For Forex market we need to keep track of __Volatility (نوسان)__ and Billinger bands are crucial for measuring it. The higher the volatility, the more players are in the market. The less volatility, the less players exist.

When the billinger bands squeeze in, it shows we have less players in the market. and shows that the trend is slowing down when we have less players.
 

- When we want to decide based on bollinger bands, we can use RSI (Relative Strength Index) and see if there is any divergence. for example, the top of the trends that touch the bollinger bands, are going up, however the RSI goes down in the same period and it means that there is weakness in the market. 
(bollinger-band-RSI-divergence.jpg)


#### Commodity Channel Index (CCI)

by default, it has +100 and -100 lines. For this indicator, what we need is the times the CCI graph goes above +100 or under -100. The reason is, when this happens we figure out that the prices are so much above or under the price range.

We can use this to find out when a new trend is being built up. for this we need two more indicators.  one is the moving averages, and the second is the momentum indicator.

#### How the moving average helps? 
We add two moving averages for period of 10 and 20. When it's going up, we are looking for 10 period line, crosses over the 20 period line (the values are higher than) and when it is going down, we look for 10 going under 20 line (values are lower than).

For more confirmation, we can take a look at Momentum. In momentum we can draw a line at 100, and above that, the market is in uptrend and below it the market is in downtrend. 

Now to put all three together (CCI, Moving Average, and Momentum), we can input a vertical line where the 10-20 period average lines cross each other. 

Now we check 3 things:

```
1) moving average 10 period, crosses moving average of 20 and it is above the 20 line.
2) the momentum graph(reading) is above 100
3) we look if there is an extreme point happened before the cross point in CCI graph.
```

If all the three conditions are true, there is a good time to buy because most probably, the trend is going up.


#### Moving Averages:

The calculation is the sum of closing price of N trading sessions, and dividing them to N. The 10 and 20 period we talked about above, was the N in the formula here. 

There are two types of moving averages. 

1) __Simple Moving Average:__ It gives the same weight for to all sessions when calculating the formula.

2) __Exponential Moving Average:__ It gives more weight to the latest sessions. 

When we have sudden changes in the market trend, the simple moving average won't be good enough to reflect what is going on.  

#### Parabolic SAR:

The idea, is when the Parabolic SAR indicator dots, come above the price graph, we are looking for sell, and if they place below the main graph, we will want to buy.

But it is not enough to only use this indicator. we need to check more indicators for example Momentum indicator. because SAR doesn't really show if a trend is being built or not.

#### MACD indicator: (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):

It has a histogram for each session, and a moving average for the default value of 9 sessions for each period.


#### ATR (Average True Range):

The main purpose of ATR is to measure the volatility (نوسانจ).

We need to have a horizontal line at 0.00060 and have the chart time for H1. It is recommended. can be any number. 

__IMPORTANT:__ anytime we have the ATR going underneath the 0.00060 line and timing H1, it is about to be start a new trend (upwards or downwards.)

In order to use this predictor we need to check three more things:
```
1- The prices (graph) should be above the 8 or 10 period average line.
2- The cross over of 8 and 20, that 8 has to locate on the top of 20 for uptrend and lower for downtrend.
3- We need to check if the same situation is true for 4 hours period.
```
If all the conditions above are true, we can do the trade.

#### Momentun and its use:

We always put a center line at 100. Then all we have to worry about, is to make sure, when momentum is under the center line, don't buy and when it is above the center line, don't sell.

Another way of using momentum, is by looking for divergence between prices and the momentum indicator. Sometimes the direction of two lower points, go lower, but in momentum at the same time, the momentum increases. When such a thing happens, we place a trade at the same level as the peak between two points locates. (momentum-divergence.jpg)
